                <p class="para">
                    A security door lock system is developed with the help of an Arduino and a finger print sensor.
                    The operation of the system is to scan the finger of the person and match it with the stored oneâ€™s
                    and giving
                    authorization to the person. It will be useful to restrict the entry of the unauthorized people into
                    the secure places.

                <p class="para">A Detection system is developed to prevent the vehicle accidents due to the drowsiness of driver.
                    Here
                    by using a camera the system will continuously monitor the driver eyes, if they are enclosed more
                    than the
                    threshold value then the system will raise an alarm to wake him up. This system will help to reduce
                    the road
                    accidents and save the people.</p>

                    using
                    clap sound we can turn on and off the lights and fans in a room. Here we used 555 Timer IC for
                    switching
                    mechanism. This will help for the persons who can not stand on their legs to switch on the lights.
